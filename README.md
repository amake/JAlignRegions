Hello Professor Church

I am a developer working on a FOSS (GPLv3) text alignment tool and I am interested in your algorithm. I have made a Java port of the code for align_regions.c in your paper here:
https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kchurch/wwwfiles/published_1991_acl.txt

I am unclear regarding the licensing issues surrounding a port of the code from your paper, but I believe that I need your permission to release my port at all. May I do so under GPLv3?

Thanks for your consideration,
Aaron
